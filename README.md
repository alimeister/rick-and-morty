# Rick and Morty | Computer Vision Game
I built a Computer Vision GUI game where I integrated Hand Gesture Tracking using MediaPipe (an open-source framework to “build word-class machine learning solutions” by Google) and OpenCV to save Rick C-137 from Evil Morty.   It involves two stages: Palm detection and Hand landmarks identification.
